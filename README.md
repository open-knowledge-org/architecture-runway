# Architectural Runway during an Agile Software Project
The Architectural Runway consists of the existing code, components, and technical infrastructure needed to implement near-term features without excessive redesign and delay.

Frequently we hear such a kind of statement like bellow: 
*"Architecture is the part of your system that is to difficult to change"*

Also, they say Architecture Design is just the part where the System or Software Architects play around doing diagrams in Power Point or wasting time in MS Paint. 

These statements are **NOT** true... 

**Organization > Architecture < Process**
